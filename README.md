# HIDET: A compilation-based DNN inference framework

## Introduction
Hidet is a DNN inference framework based on compilation. It takes an ONNX model as input, conducts a series of graph-level and operator-level optimizations, and does inference.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Run the following command to install hidet
```bash
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/yaoyaoding/hidet.git
```

For developers, we recommend clone the repository and run the following editable installation
```bash
pip install -e .
```
so that any modification would reflect immediately without reinstallation.

TODO: add remaining part of Getting Started section.
